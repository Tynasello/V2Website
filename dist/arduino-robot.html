            <h1>Arduino Robot</h1>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this project was to create a fully functional robot using an arduino microcontroller
                that could be controlled by a mobile device. The robot performs certain maneuvers
                based on input from a bluetooth terminal application.
                <br><br>
                The robot has an optional "autonomous mode" which can be activated by typing the character 'a'
                through a bluetooth terminal app on a cellular device. When autonomous mode is activated, the
                robot will drive forward until the ultrasonic sensor on the front of the chassis detects that an
                object
                is within 10 cm. The robot will then redirect its route and
                continue driving forward until another object is encountered.

            <h3>Arduino Uno Micro Controller</h3>
            <p>
                The arduino uno is a microcontroller that is responsible for commanding all parts of the robot.
                The arduino has digital input/output pins and analog pins that are responsible for sending and
                receiving data.
                The analog pins of the arduino allow the use of the ultrasonic sensor. The digital pins allow the
                use of the HC-08 bluetooth module. The arduino is powered by a USB powerbank via the USB port.

            <h3>L293D Motor Controller Shield</h3>
            <p>The L293D Motor Controller Shield controls the two motors on the chassis, receiving instructions
                from the Arduino UNO. The L293D allows the forward and backward movements of the wheels at
                various speeds. The wires of the motors are inserted and fastened down into the M1 (DC Motor 1) and
                M3 (DC Motor 2) terminal blocks, allowing the arduino to control the motors. The shield attaches
                directly on
                top of the Arduino and plugs into the input/output pins. Since the shield blocks direct
                access to the arduino's pins, wires were soldered onto the shield to allow the
                use of the pins, which are essential to use of the bluetooth module, breadboard and ultrasonic
                sensor.

            <h3>HC-08 Bluetooth Module</h3>
            <p>
                All actions performed by the robot are due to input from a mobile device using an HC-08 bluetooth
                module. The RX (Receiving) pin on the module connects to the TX (Transmitting) pin on the arduino
                board, and the TX pin on the module connects to the RX pin on the arduino. This allows data to be
                transferred between a device and the arduino. As a result, when specific characters are sent
                via a bluetooth terminal app to the arduino, certain maneuvers can be performed by the robot.

            <h3>Chassis</h3>
            <p>The chassis consists of two motors and two wheels. The Arduino and L293D bridge are fitted in the
                middle of the chassis. The breadboard, which contains the ultrasonic sensor and allows circuits to
                be built, is secured at the front of the chassis. The bluetooth module, as well as some loose wires
                are strapped to the chassis with a zip tie. The USB power bank, which supplies power
                to the robot, is fastened to the bottom, rear portion of the chassis, using metal strapping.

            <h3>Coding</h3>
            <p>
                The program to control this robot was written in the <a
                class ="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/
                main/software">Arduino IDE </a>using the programming language C/C++. The AFMotor.h library was included
                to provide simultaneous speed and directional control for the motors alongside the L293D
                shield. The NewPing.h library was included to incorporate ultrasonic sensor functionality. The
                library provides ultrasonic sensor functionality. Lastly, the
                SoftwareSerial.h library was included to allow serial communication between a mobile device and the
                Arduino via the
                HC-08. This allows the robot to move in certain directions based on input data from a device. A link
                to my code for this project can be found below.
